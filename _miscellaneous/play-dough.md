### Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup fine table salt
- 1 teaspoon cream of tartar
- 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1/2 cup boiling water
- Food coloring
- 20 drops for bold colors, 10 for pastels

### Instructions

1. Whisk together flour, salt, and cream of tartar.
2. Make a well in the center of the bowl and add vegetable oil, boiling water and food coloring.
3. Stir until a dough forms (if mixing by hand, a rubber spatula works great). Add a little bit more flour or oil if needed.
4. When the dough is cool enough to touch knead until all flour in incorporated and dough is soft and uniform in color.
5. Let play dough cool completely before playing with it!
