### Ingredients

- 1½ tablespoons instant dry yeast

- 2 cups warm water
- 1½ teaspoons salt
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 5 cups flour
- pizza sauce
- cheese

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine yeast, brown sugar and water. Let rest 5 minutes (or until bubbles start to form)
3. Add flour, salt and olive oil. Knead on low about 8 minutes/until the dough forms a nice, soft, somewhat sticky ball and the sides of the bowl are clean.
4. Let rise covered in a lightly greased bowl 1-1.5 hours (until doubled).
5. Divide the dough into desired pizza sizes and roll out on parchment paper covered trays. Let rise another 30 minutes if desired.
    - 1 Extra Extra Large
    - 2 Large
    - 3 Medium
6. Par-bake the pizza(s) ~10minutes. They should be puffy and dry on the top, but still very pale.
7. Let them cool completely on a wire rack.
8. Top the pizza(s) with desired toppings.
9. Freeze the pizza(s) uncovered, until solid
10. Wrap the pizza(s) in plastic wrap and aluminum foil. (They can stay frozen up to three months)
11. When ready to eat, bake from frozen at 500 degrees until cheese is browning and bubbly, about 10-15 minutes depending on size and thickness of crust.
