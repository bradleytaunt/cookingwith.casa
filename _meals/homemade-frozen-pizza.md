### Ingredients

- 1&frac12; tablespoons instant dry yeast
- 1&frac12; tablespoons brown sugar
- 1&frac12; teaspoons salt
- 2 cups warm water
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 5 cups flour
- pizza sauce
- cheese
- toppings

### Instructions

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine yeast, brown sugar, salt, water, and flour.
2. Knead on low until dough starts to come together. Continue kneading until the dough forms a nice, soft dough ball and the sides of the bowl are clean.
3. Let rise in a lightly greased bowl, covered, for 1 to 2 hours, until doubled.
4. Divide the dough into three equal pieces and roll out into pizza crusts.
5. Place crust on a tray for freezing.
6. Top with desired sauce, cheese, and other toppings.
7. Freeze.
8. Once solid, wrap with plastic wrap and store in the freezer. Pizzas stay good for 1 to 3 months.
9. To bake, preheat a pizza stone in the oven at 500 degrees. Bake until cheese is browning and bubbly, about 10 to 15 minutes.
