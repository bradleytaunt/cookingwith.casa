- 1 &frac14; cups unsweetened applesauce
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 Tablespoons butter , melted (or coconut oil)

- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with liners or grease with non-stick cooking spray. Set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, stir together the oats, applesauce, milk, egg, vanilla, butter and sugar.
3. In a large bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt and cranberries or raisins.
4. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the applesauce mixture. Stir just until combined (don't overmix!)
5. Spoon the batter evenly into the muffin cups. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
