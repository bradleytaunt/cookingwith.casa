### Ingredients

- 2 cups of powdered sugar
- 6-8 tsp of milk
- 4 tsp of corn syrup
- &frac12; tsp of vanilla extract (or almond extract)
- food coloring (*optional*)

### Instructions

1. Sift powdered sugar into a medium bowl. Add 6 teaspoons milk, corn syrup, and extract. Stir vigorously until icing is smooth
2. If needed, add additional milk to thin icing more. You've reached the correct consistency for
frosting if a scoop of icing slowly falls off the spoon. If making colored icing, divide into bowls
and add food coloring
