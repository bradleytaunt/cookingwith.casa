### Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup Dutch process cocoa
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
- 3 large brown bananas (1 1/2 cups mashed)
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil, 
- 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- *Optional*: 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

### Instructions

1. Heat oven to 350Â°F
2. Grease a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and sea salt. Set aside.
4. In a large bowl, mash the ripe bananas. Add the melted butter and oil, stir until combined. 
5. Stir in the brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Stir until smooth.
6. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, don't overmix. 
7. *Optional*: Stir in 3/4 cup of the chocolate chips.
8. Pour batter into prepared pan, sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup of chocolate chips over the top of the bread. 
9. Bake for 50-65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out mostly clean (You just don't want a lot of gooey batter. Check at 50 minutes)
10. Remove the pan from the oven and set on a wire cooling rack. Let the bread cool in the pan for 15 minutes.
11. Run a knife around the edges of the bread and carefully remove from the pan. Let the bread cool on the wire cooling rack until slightly warm. Cut into slices and serve.
