### Ingredients

- 1&frac12; cups whole wheat flour
- &frac12; cup cocoa powder
- 1 tsp of baking powder
- &frac34; tsp of baking soda
- &frac14; tsp of salt
- 1-2 ripe avocados
- &frac34; cup of maple syrup (I usually use only &#8531; because I'm a meanie)
- &frac34; cup of milk
- &#8531; cup of olive oil (when I'm feeling fancy I use melted coconut oil)
- 1 tsp of vanilla extract

### Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350F.
2. Prepare your muffin tins by greasing with non-stick cooking spray or baking liners.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
4. In a food processor, puree the avocado, maple syrup, melted coconut oil, almond milk and vanilla extract until smooth.[^1]
5. Make a well in the dry mixture and add the wet mixture to the dry mixture. Stir together with a wooden smooth until just combined.
6. Scoop the batter into the muffin tins and bake for 15-20 minutes until the tops are slightly cracked.
7. Remove from the oven and do not remove from the muffin tins for an additional 15 minutes to let them cool.
8. Keep stored in an air-tight container. You can also keep them stored in the fridge...they actually taste fantastic cold!

[^1]:Honestly, I just use a potato masher because I'm lazy and hate cleaning the food processor. But in warning, there will be green lumps in your finished product, haha! The butts don't complain though
