### Ingredients

#### Dough
- 1 cup warm water
- 1/4 cup whole milk
- 2 Tbsp sour cream
- 1 large egg
- 1 tsp salt, (plus more for cooking)
- 4 cups all-purpose flour

#### Potato Filling
- 5 medium potatoes (peeled)
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 Tbsp Butter (softened)
- 1 Cup Shredded Cheddar cheese [**OR**] 8 ounces Farmer's Cheese (Ricotta)

### Instructions

#### Filling:

1. Bring potatoes to a boil and continue cooking 25 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork.
2. Mash in salt, butter and cheese. Partially cover and let cool while you prepare the dough.

#### Dough:

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer whisk together warm water, milk, sour cream, egg and salt until blended.
2. Using the dough hook attachment, add 2 cups flour and mix until incorporated. Add remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time until the dough stops sticking to the sides of the bowl. Knead for 5 minutes, or when the dough is smooth. Cover.

### Assembly

1. Divide dough into 2-3 pieces. Thinly roll the first piece on a floured surface to ~1/8" thickness.
2. Cut ~3" circles from the dough (using a cookie cutter or upside down glass) and add 1/2 Tbsp of filling into each round.
3. Fold in half and pinch to seal. The traditional pinch and twist motion is preferred...)
4. Cook or freeze pierogi at this time

### Cooking from Frozen

1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.
2. Add pierogi. Allow water to return to a boil, then reduce heat and cook additional 3 minutes if fresh, 5 minutes if frozen (or until they are all floating).
3. Using a slotted spoon, remove from pot and place in serving dish. Drizzle with butter between layers to prevent sticking.

### Cooking from "Fresh"

1. Melt butter in frying pan and add pierogi to form a single layer. Add onions at this point if desired.
2. Flip pierogi at least once and cook about 5 minutes, or until slightly browned and onions are soft.
