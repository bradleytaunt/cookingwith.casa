### Ingredients

- 1&frac12; tablespoons instant dry yeast
- pinch of sugar
- 1&frac12; tablespoons instant dry yeast
- 2 cups warm water
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 5 cups flour

### Dough Instructions

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine yeast, sugar, salt, water, oil and flour.
2. Knead on low until dough starts to come together. Continue kneading until the dough forms a nice, soft dough ball and the sides of the bowl are clean.
3. Let rise in a lightly greased bowl, covered, for 1 to 2 hours, until doubled.
4. Divide the dough into one, two, or three equal pieces, and roll out into pizza crusts

### Cooking Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
2. Bake in oven 10-12min (You want it baked about half way through...it will look dry on top but wonâ€™t be browned).
3. Set aside and let cool to room temperature (15-30 minutes).
4. Spread your sauce on, top with your meat and cheese.
5. Wrap it in plastic wrap and then tin foil (freeze up to three months).
6. When ready to serve, heat oven to 425 degrees F and bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown and cheese is melted.
